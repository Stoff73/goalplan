This file contains ALL the critical information:
- Complete agent delegation rules
- Testing strategy (Jest vs Playwright)
- Context file descriptions
- Task workflow
- Code quality standards
- Performance targets
- Security requirements

**Then** proceed with the phase task files.

### 2. Work Sequentially
- Complete phases in order (0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5)
