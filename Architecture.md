# Architecture

## Key Technical Features - Architecture

**Modular Design & Technical Approach:**

- **Modular design** - Each module independent
- **API-first approach** - All functionality exposed through well-defined APIs
- **Multi-currency support** - GBP, ZAR, and other currencies
- **Historical data tracking** - Temporal queries for point-in-time analysis
- **Real-time calculations** - Immediate feedback on financial decisions
- **Async job processing** - Background processing for heavy computations
- **Caching strategies** - Optimize performance and reduce database load

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each financial module (Protection, Savings, Investment, Retirement, IHT) operates independently
2. **Scalability**: Designed to handle growing user base and data volume
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and well-documented APIs
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new modules, jurisdictions, or features
5. **Interoperability**: Seamless data flow between modules for comprehensive analysis
