# Comprehensive Development Task List

## Dual-Country Financial Planning Platform

**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025
**Document Purpose:** Step-by-step development checklist with testing gates and agent delegation
**Critical Rule:** ‚õî **DO NOT PROCEED TO NEXT PHASE UNTIL ALL TESTS PASS** ‚õî

---

## How to Use This Document

1. **Work sequentially** - Complete tasks in order within each phase
2. **Reference shard files** - Each task references the relevant shard(s) for detailed specs
3. **Delegate to agents** - Use specialized agents for Python backend and React frontend tasks
4. **Test continuously** - Run tests after each task, fix immediately
5. **Testing Gates** - Must pass 100% of tests before proceeding to next phase
6. **Check boxes** - Mark tasks complete only when all tests pass
7. **Maintain functionality** - App must remain functional throughout development
