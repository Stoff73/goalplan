## Browser Testing Status

**Status:** ⚠️ READY FOR BROWSER TESTING

**To Test:**
1. Start backend: `./start.sh` from project root
2. Wait for services to start (5-10 seconds)
3. Open browser to http://localhost:5173
4. Login with test credentials
5. Navigate to Goals page
6. Test functionality:
   - [ ] Dashboard displays correctly
   - [ ] Create goal form works
   - [ ] Goal details view renders
   - [ ] Edit goal functionality
   - [ ] Delete confirmation
   - [ ] Filtering and sorting
   - [ ] Navigation between views

**Expected Issues:**
- None anticipated - components follow established patterns
- API endpoints already tested and working
- UI components from 'internal-packages/ui' are proven

---

## Next Steps (User/Manual Testing)

### Critical Testing Protocol (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ RULE: NO CODE CHANGE IS COMPLETE WITHOUT BROWSER TESTING**

1. **Restart services** (if backend changes):
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh && ./start.sh
   ```

2. **Wait for startup** (5-10 seconds)

3. **Open browser** to http://localhost:5173

4. **Test affected pages:**
   - Navigate to /goals
   - Create a new goal
   - View goal details
   - Edit a goal
   - Test filtering
   - Test delete with confirmation

5. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors

6. **Check Network tab** for failed API requests

7. **Verify functionality** actually works

8. **ONLY THEN** mark task complete

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **STYLEGUIDE.md Compliance is Key**
   - Reading STYLEGUIDE.md before implementation ensured consistency
   - Narrative storytelling approach makes financial data approachable
   - Embedding metrics in sentences vs standalone displays is more engaging

2. **React 19 Patterns Work Well**
   - No forwardRef simplifies component structure
   - Clean, functional components are easier to maintain
   - Minimal useEffect usage improves performance

3. **Progressive Disclosure Reduces Complexity**
   - "Tell me more" sections keep interface clean
   - Expandable recommendations don't overwhelm users
   - Optional features are truly optional

4. **Testing Reveals Edge Cases**
   - React act() warnings indicate async state updates
   - Mocking fetch requires careful setup
   - E2E tests validate complete user journeys
