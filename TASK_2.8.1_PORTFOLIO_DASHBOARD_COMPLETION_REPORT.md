volatile in the short term, but long-term investing typically smooths out
these fluctuations."
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (29 tests)
1. **Loading State** - Verifies loading indicator appears
2. **Error Handling** - Tests error display and retry functionality
3. **Empty State** - Validates new user experience
4. **Data Rendering** - Confirms all data displays correctly
5. **Color Coding** - Ensures gains/losses use correct colors
6. **Accessibility** - Validates ARIA attributes and keyboard nav
7. **Currency Formatting** - Tests number formatting logic
8. **Progressive Disclosure** - Tests expand/collapse functionality

### Mock Data
- Realistic portfolio data structure
- Positive and negative gain scenarios
- Multiple asset classes
- Top 10 holdings with various performance
- Benchmark comparison data

### API Mocking
- All `fetch` calls mocked with `jest.fn()`
- Auth token validation tested
- 401/404/500 error scenarios covered
- Loading delay scenarios tested

---

## Code Quality

### React 19 Patterns
- ✅ No `forwardRef` (not needed in React 19)
- ✅ No unnecessary `useEffect` (only for data fetching)
- ✅ Functional components throughout
- ✅ Clear prop interfaces (via JSDoc)
- ✅ Proper state management

### Import Structure
```javascript
// UI components from internal-packages/ui (NOT @/components/ui)
import { Card, Button, Alert } from 'internal-packages/ui';

// Auth utility
import { authStorage } from '../../utils/auth';
```

### Code Organization
- Clear component structure
- Styles defined inline (following pattern)
- Helper functions (formatCurrency, formatPercentage)
- Logical section grouping
- Self-documenting code

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- ✅ Single API call on mount
- ✅ No N+1 query patterns
- ✅ Efficient re-renders (React 19 automatic batching)
- ✅ Lazy loading ready (code splitting possible)

### Bundle Size
- Minimal dependencies (UI components only)
- No heavy charting library (simple visual breakdown)
- Inline styles (no additional CSS bundle)

---

## Accessibility Compliance

### WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- ✅ **Color Contrast:** 4.5:1 minimum for all text
- ✅ **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements focusable
- ✅ **Screen Reader:** Semantic HTML with ARIA labels
- ✅ **Focus Indicators:** Visible focus states on all buttons
- ✅ **Alt Text:** N/A (no images, using semantic color coding)

### Semantic HTML
```html
<h1> - Page title
<h3> - Section headings
<p> - Narrative paragraphs
<strong> - Metric emphasis
<table> - Tabular data
<button> - Interactive elements
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2.8 Next Steps
1. **Interactive Charts:** Add pie/donut chart for asset allocation
2. **Sortable Tables:** Implement column sorting for holdings table
3. **Filters:** Add filtering by asset class, region, account
4. **Export:** PDF/CSV export functionality
5. **Performance Charts:** Line chart for portfolio value over time
6. **Drill-Down:** Click holdings to view detailed pages
7. **Refresh:** Manual refresh button with timestamp

### Integration Points
- Link to detailed performance page
- Link to holdings management page
- Link to add new investment account flow
- Link to asset allocation recommendations

---

## Lessons Learned

### Test Development
1. **Text Matching:** When elements contain multiple text segments, avoid overly complex regex patterns
2. **Multiple Elements:** Use `getAllByText` when text appears in multiple locations
3. **Mock Precision:** Mock API responses thoroughly to avoid flaky tests
4. **Iterative Fixing:** Fix tests incrementally rather than all at once

### STYLEGUIDE.md Adherence
1. **Narrative First:** Writing conversational copy takes more thought but creates better UX
2. **Metrics in Context:** Embedding numbers in sentences is more readable than labels
3. **Progressive Disclosure:** Users appreciate optional complexity
4. **Color Semantics:** Consistent color usage (green=good, red=attention) builds intuition
