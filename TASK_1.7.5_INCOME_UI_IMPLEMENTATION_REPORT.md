- Modals unmount when closed
- Event listeners cleaned up properly

### Error Handling

- Real-time validation on field blur
- Clear error messages below inputs
- Submit disabled until valid
- Field-specific error styling

**API Errors:**
- Network errors caught and displayed
- User-friendly error messages

## Educational Content Examples

### Gross vs. Net Income

> "Gross = before tax, Net = after tax. Choose gross for accurate tax calculations. We'll automatically factor in tax when computing your liability."

### Foreign Income

> "Income from outside the UK and SA. We'll calculate tax treatment under Double Tax Agreements to prevent you from being taxed twice on the same income."

### Tax Withholding

> "Tax already deducted (PAYE in UK, PASE in SA). This will be credited against your final tax liability when you file your return."

### Currency Conversion

> "We track your income in the currency you received it, then convert to GBP and ZAR for tax calculations using official exchange rates."

### Personal Savings Allowance

> "Your first £1,000 of savings interest is tax-free in the UK (Personal Savings Allowance). We'll automatically apply this when calculating your tax."

   - No multi-select for batch actions

2. **Client-Side Filtering:**
   - All incomes loaded at once
   - May be slow with >100 entries
   - Should add server-side filtering in Phase 2

3. **No Export:**
   - Cannot export income data
   - No PDF/CSV generation
   - Manual entry required for tax returns

4. **No Tax Calculations:**
   - Shows amounts but not tax due
   - No marginal rate display
   - Tax treatment is descriptive only

5. **No Recurring Income:**
   - Must manually add monthly income 12 times
   - No auto-generation from frequency
   - Future: recurring income templates

### Test Warnings

**Multiple Text Matches:**
- Some tests show warnings about finding multiple elements with same text
- This is intentional per STYLEGUIDE.md (amounts in narrative + metrics)
- Tests use `getAllBy*` variants where appropriate
- Does not affect functionality
