# Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation

**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Critical Rule:** ⛔ **DO NOT PROCEED TO NEXT PHASE UNTIL ALL TESTS PASS** ⛔

---

## 📋 Overview

**Goal:** Set up complete development environment with all tools, frameworks, and infrastructure ready for Phase 1 development.

**Prerequisites:** None

**Outputs:**
- Fully operational development environment
- All services running (backend, frontend, database, Redis)
- Testing infrastructure configured
- Documentation framework in place

---

## 🔧 Instructions

**Before starting any task:**
1. Read `.claude/instructions.md` for complete agent delegation rules and testing strategy
2. Each task below marked with 🐍 or ⚛️ shows which agent to use
3. Read all listed "Context Files" before implementing

**Task markers:**
- 🐍 = Delegate to `python-backend-engineer` agent
- ⚛️ = Delegate to `react-coder` agent

# PHASE 0: PROJECT SETUP & FOUNDATION

## 0.1 Development Environment Setup

### Task 0.1.1: Initialize Project Structure

**Context Files:** `Architecture.md`, `DataManagement.md`

- [ ] Create repository with appropriate .gitignore
- [ ] Set up monorepo structure (frontend/backend/shared)
- [ ] Initialize package managers (npm for frontend, pip for backend)
- [ ] Configure version control (Git with feature branch workflow)
- [ ] Set up development branch protection rules
- [ ] **Test:** Verify clean repository structure, all team members can clone

### Task 0.1.2: Configure Development Tools

**Context Files:** `Architecture.md`

- [ ] Set up linting (ESLint, Prettier for frontend)
- [ ] Configure backend linting/formatting (black, isort, mypy)
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks (lint, format, basic tests)
- [ ] Configure EditorConfig for consistency
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline basics (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI)
- [ ] **Test:** Run lint on empty project structure, should pass with 0 errors

### Task 0.1.3: Database Setup

**🐍 DELEGATE TO: `python-backend-engineer`**
**Context Files:** `Architecture.md`, `DataManagement.md`, `securityCompliance.md`

**Agent Instructions:**
1. Read Architecture.md for database design principles
2. Read DataManagement.md for data handling requirements
3. Read securityCompliance.md for security requirements

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Choose database (PostgreSQL recommended for relational data)
- [ ] Set up local development database
- [ ] Configure database migrations system (Alembic)
- [ ] Create initial database connection config
- [ ] Set up Redis for caching and sessions
- [ ] **Test:** Connect to database successfully, run empty migration

### Task 0.1.4: Backend Framework Setup

**🐍 DELEGATE TO: `python-backend-engineer`**
**Context Files:** `Architecture.md`, `performance.md`, `securityCompliance.md`

**Agent Instructions:**
1. Read Architecture.md for API-first approach and modular design
2. Read performance.md for performance targets
3. Read securityCompliance.md for security headers and logging requirements

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Initialize backend framework (FastAPI recommended)
- [ ] Use `pip` for dependency management
- [ ] Configure environment variables (.env setup)
- [ ] Set up logging system
- [ ] Configure error handling middleware
- [ ] Set up health check endpoint (`/health`)
- [ ] **Test:** Start backend server, access health check endpoint, returns 200

### Task 0.1.5: Frontend Framework Setup

**⚛️ DELEGATE TO: `react-coder`**
**Context Files:** `Architecture.md`, `UserFlows.md`, `performance.md`

**Agent Instructions:**
1. Read Architecture.md for frontend architecture principles
2. Read UserFlows.md for UX requirements
3. Read performance.md for performance targets

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Initialize frontend framework (React 19)
- [ ] Set up routing system
- [ ] Configure state management (Context API)
- [ ] Set up API client (fetch wrapper)
- [ ] Configure environment-specific settings
- [ ] Import UI components from 'internal-packages/ui'
- [ ] **Test:** Start frontend dev server, see default page load without errors

### Task 0.1.6: Testing Infrastructure

**Context Files:** `Architecture.md`, `riskMitigation.md`

- [ ] **Backend (🐍 DELEGATE):** Set up pytest framework
- [ ] **Frontend (⚛️ DELEGATE):** Set up Jest
- [ ] Configure integration testing framework
- [ ] Set up E2E testing framework (Playwright)
- [ ] Create test database seeding scripts
- [ ] Configure test coverage reporting (aim for >80%)
- [ ] **Test:** Run empty test suite, should pass (0 tests, 0 failures)

### Task 0.1.7: Documentation Setup

**Context Files:** `Architecture.md`

- [ ] Set up API documentation (OpenAPI)
- [ ] Create README with setup instructions
- [ ] Initialize architecture decision records (ADR) folder
- [ ] Set up inline code documentation standards
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
- [ ] **Test:** Generate API documentation, view in browser

## 🚦 PHASE 0 TESTING GATE

### Must Pass Before Proceeding

- [ ] ✅ All services start without errors (backend, frontend, database, Redis)
- [ ] ✅ Health check endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] ✅ Frontend loads default page successfully
