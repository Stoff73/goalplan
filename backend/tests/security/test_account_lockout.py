"""
Comprehensive test suite for account lockout functionality.

This test suite verifies the account lockout mechanism that prevents brute force attacks:

Requirements (from userAuth.md Feature 1.2):
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (30 min cooldown)
- Return 423 Locked status when account is locked
- Track failed login attempts per email
- Track failed login attempts per IP
- Lockout expires after 30 minutes automatically
- Reset counter on successful login

Security features tested:
1. Basic lockout (5 failed attempts locks account)
2. Locked account returns 423 status
3. Lockout expiration after 30 minutes
4. Successful login resets counter
5. Lockout is per-user (not global)
6. Lockout by email (multiple IPs attacking same account)
7. Lockout by IP (one IP attacking multiple accounts) - informational only
8. Partial failure then success resets counter
9. Lockout message includes retry-after information
10. Time window for counting attempts (30 minutes)
11. Lockout persists across requests (database-backed)
12. Concurrent login attempts during lockout

Coverage: Account lockout service, login endpoint, login_attempt tracking
