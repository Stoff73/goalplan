"""
Tests for rate limiting middleware.

This module tests the rate limiting functionality on API endpoints including:
- Rate limit enforcement on registration endpoint
- Different IPs having separate rate limits
- Rate limit headers in responses
- Rate limit exceeded error responses
- Rate limit reset after time window

Test Coverage:
- Registration endpoint rate limiting (5 requests/hour/IP)
- Proper 429 responses when limit exceeded
- Rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)
- Different IPs tested separately
