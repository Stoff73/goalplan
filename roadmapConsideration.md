## Development Principles

1. **Iterative Delivery**: Release working features early and often
2. **User Feedback**: Incorporate feedback at each phase
3. **Modular Architecture**: Each phase builds on previous without refactoring
4. **Quality First**: Comprehensive testing before moving to next phase
5. **Compliance Focus**: Regular legal and regulatory review
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous optimization and scaling
7. **Documentation**: Keep technical and user documentation current

## Success Criteria Per Phase

**Phase 1**: 100 active users, basic financial tracking working
**Phase 2**: 500 active users, full financial picture captured
**Phase 3**: 1,500 active users, professional-grade planning tools
**Phase 4**: 5,000 active users, intelligent recommendations driving action
**Phase 5**: 15,000+ active users, market leader in dual-country space

## Risk Mitigation

- **Technical debt**: Allocate 20% of each phase for refactoring
- **Scope creep**: Strict phase boundaries, parking lot for future ideas
- **Resource constraints**: Prioritize ruthlessly, consider outsourcing non-core
- **Market changes**: Regular competitive analysis, flexible roadmap
- **Regulatory changes**: Monitor tax law changes, rapid update capability
