# Performance

## Key Technical Features - Performance

**Performance Requirements & Optimization:**

- **Target response times:**
  - Dashboard: <1 second
  - Tax calculations: <200ms
  - AI recommendations: <3 seconds
- **Caching strategies** - Redis for session/calculation caching, materialized views for reporting
- **Async processing for heavy computations** - Background jobs for complex calculations
- **Batch jobs for periodic updates** - Off-peak processing for data aggregation
- **Scalable infrastructure** - Horizontal scaling capability for growth

## Performance Optimization Strategies

1. **Caching Layers**:
   - Redis for session management and frequently accessed data
   - Materialized views for complex aggregations
   - CDN for static assets
   - Client-side caching for unchanged data

2. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Message queues for background jobs
   - Non-blocking I/O for API calls
   - Parallel processing for independent calculations

3. **Database Optimization**:
   - Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
   - Query optimization and explain plan analysis
   - Connection pooling
   - Read replicas for reporting queries

4. **Load Management**:
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Load balancing across multiple servers
   - Auto-scaling based on demand
   - Circuit breakers for external service calls

5. **Monitoring & Alerting**:
   - Real-time performance monitoring
   - Automated alerts for performance degradation
   - Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools
   - Regular load testing and capacity planning
