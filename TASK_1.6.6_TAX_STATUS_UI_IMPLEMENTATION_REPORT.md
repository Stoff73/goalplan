## API Integration

### Endpoints Added to `utils/api.js`

```javascript
export const taxStatusEndpoints = {
  getCurrent: () => authApi.get('/api/v1/user/tax-status'),
  create: (data) => authApi.post('/api/v1/user/tax-status', data),
  getHistory: () => authApi.get('/api/v1/user/tax-status/history'),
  getAtDate: (date) => authApi.get(`/api/v1/user/tax-status/at-date?date=${date}`),
  calculateSRT: (data) => authApi.post('/api/v1/user/tax-status/srt-calculator', data),
  calculateSAPresence: (data) => authApi.post('/api/v1/user/tax-status/sa-presence-test', data),
  getDeemedDomicile: () => authApi.get('/api/v1/user/tax-status/deemed-domicile'),
};
```

### Data Flow

1. **Page Load:**
   - Parallel fetch: Current status, history, deemed domicile
   - Handle 404 gracefully (no status yet)
   - Show update form if no current status

2. **Create Tax Status:**
   - Validate form data
   - POST to `/api/v1/user/tax-status`
   - Backend auto-adjusts previous record's `effective_to`
   - Reload all data
   - Show success message

3. **Calculate Residency:**
   - POST to calculator endpoints
   - Display results with detailed breakdown
   - Educational content based on result
   - Option to save result (future enhancement)

## Design Patterns from STYLEGUIDE.md

### ✅ Narrative Storytelling Approach

**Applied Throughout:**
- Conversational headings: "Your current tax status" not "Tax Status Record"
- Plain-language explanations embedded in narrative
- "You're worth £X" style phrasing
- Context with every number: "You've been UK resident for 5 of the last 20 years"

**Examples:**
```
❌ "Tax Status: UK Resident"
✅ "You're considered a UK tax resident. This means you're liable to UK tax on your worldwide income."

❌ "Deemed Domicile: False"
✅ "You're not deemed UK domiciled. You've been UK resident for 5 of the last 20 years (need 15)."
```

### ✅ Progressive Disclosure

**Implementation:**
- "What is domicile? →" expandable sections
- "Tell me more" links for complex concepts
- Collapsed calculator explanations by default
- Historical timeline: Summary view → Full details on click

### ✅ Educational by Default

**Every Section Includes:**
- Plain English explanations
- Expandable definitions for jargon
- Examples: "For example, if you spent 125 days in the UK..."
- "Why it matters" sections
- Links to deeper learning

**Tax Terms Explained:**
- Tax resident
- Domicile
- Deemed domicile
- Split year treatment
- Remittance basis
- Ordinarily resident
- DTA tie-breaker
- Each UK SRT tie

### ✅ Generous White Space & Readability

**Applied:**
- Line height: 1.7 for narrative paragraphs
- 32px padding on cards
- 48px spacing between major sections (space-y-8 = 32px in Tailwind)
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Clear section separation

### ✅ Color Usage (Semantic)

**Implemented:**
- **Blue (#2563EB):** Primary actions, resident status badges
- **Amber (#F59E0B):** Warnings (dual residency, deemed domicile active)
- **Green (#10B981):** Positive states (calculator success results)
- **Gray:** Non-resident status, neutral information

**Educational Callouts:**
- Blue background: Info callouts (#EFF6FF bg-blue-50)
- Amber background: Warnings (#FEF3C7 bg-amber-50)
- Green background: Planning opportunities

### ✅ Conversational Tone

**Examples:**
- "You're resident in both countries" not "Dual residency detected"
- "Great progress!" celebrations
- "Here's what that means" explanations
- "Not sure if you're UK tax resident? This calculator helps..."
- Supportive, not intimidating: "Let's get started..."

## Educational Content Examples

### Tax Residency Explanations

**UK Resident:**
> "You're considered a UK tax resident. This means you're liable to UK tax on your worldwide income."

**Non-UK Resident:**
> "You're not a UK tax resident. You're only taxed on UK-source income."

**Dual Resident:**
> "You're resident in both the UK and South Africa. When you're tax resident in both countries, the Double Tax Agreement (DTA) determines which country has primary taxing rights."

### Domicile Explanations

**What is Domicile?**
> "Your domicile is your permanent home country—the place you consider your long-term base. It's different from residence. Domicile affects inheritance tax: UK domiciled individuals pay UK inheritance tax on their worldwide estate, while non-UK domiciled individuals only pay it on UK assets."

**Deemed Domicile:**
> "Deemed domicile is a UK tax concept that affects inheritance tax (IHT). Even if you're not UK domiciled by birth or choice, you become deemed UK domiciled if you've been UK tax resident for 15 of the last 20 tax years."

### Calculator Help

**SRT Family Tie:**
> "Family tie: You have a spouse, civil partner, or minor child who is UK resident. This includes your spouse, civil partner, or minor children (under 18) who are UK resident during the tax year."

**SA Presence Test:**
> "You're SA tax resident if you were physically present in South Africa for more than 91 days in the current year AND more than 91 days on average over the previous 5 years."

### Planning Opportunities

**Deemed Domicile Approaching:**
> "If you're approaching deemed domicile status, consider:
> - Reviewing your estate and potential IHT liability
> - Making gifts now (7-year rule for IHT exemption)
> - Setting up trusts to protect foreign assets
> - Discussing with a tax advisor before you become deemed domiciled"

- Cards stack vertically
- Timeline remains vertical (works on all screen sizes)
- Tabs remain horizontal (overflow scrollable if needed)

---

## Performance Considerations

### ✅ Efficient API Calls

- Graceful degradation (404 for no status)
- Single data load on mount
- Reload only after successful save

### ✅ Component Structure
- Lazy loading possible (not implemented yet)
- Components split logically for code-splitting
- Minimal re-renders (useState for local state)
- No unnecessary API calls

### ✅ Bundle Size
- UI components from shared package
